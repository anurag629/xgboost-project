# XGBoost Iris Classification

This project implements the XGBoost algorithm for the Iris dataset to classify flower species into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the Iris dataset.
- **models/**: Saved trained models.
- **notebooks/**: For experimentation and exploratory analysis.
- **results/**: Generated plots and results.
- **src/**: Source code for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- **main.py**: Main script to run the pipeline.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy on the Iris dataset and provides insights into feature importance.
